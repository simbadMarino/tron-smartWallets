TRON Simple Smart Wallet Contract (SSWC):
Note, This Smart Wallet provides the least features to decrease deployment cost as much as possible for Single Use wallets.

Goal: Reduce energy delegation and USDT transfer complexity for wallet management / payments platforms,eCommerce like Telegram Wallets, CEX or similar.



Background:
TRON is heavily used by custodial wallet, eCommerce, payments and  gift cards services due to its flexibility to offer gas-less / reduced fees transactions by staking TRX for energy.
This has considerably supported TRON's growth on USDT txns, however, due to recent TRX prize appreciation we need to explorer further ways to optimize platforms 
transactions and reduce overall on-chain fees by flexing:

1) TRON's resource model from user perspective (Staking, delegating, renting)
2) TRON's resource model from developer/bussines owner perspective (Contract Owner energy pool) 

Identified Use Cases:

    a) eCommerce or payments workflow: 
        1. ecommerce platforms creates a new account for  customer to deposit USDT or any TRC20 --> Replaced by a Simple Smart Wallet creation 
        2. User deposits the payment, this will come with a network fee 
        3. eCommerce delegate energy OR send TRX to be burned towards that account  --> Smart wallet shares contract owner energy pool, no need to delegate or send TRX to pay for fees
        5. eCommerce transfers back customer deposited tokens to Dev/Hot wallet. --> eCommerce will trigger the Withdraw function to get customer payments to their hot wallet/omni wallet.
        4. Payment is confirmed

Contract Requirements:

1. Ideally  less than 150K energy to deploy or less to be competitive with a USDT normal transfer. 
2. Withdraw TRC20 balance function (owner only)
3. Contract must be deployed with 100% Contract ration for energy consumption ratio.
4. Make it flexibile for any TRC20 token

Contract Requirements Notes after Testnet deployment:

1. Requirement Partially Achieved: After trials this contract needs 159K energy (as of Jan 29th 2025), still useful for non-throw-away use cases like custodial wallets in Telegram or CEX)
    1.a) Optimizations is neded to reduce cost of deployment. Tested with Solc optimizer enabled, 200 runs. 
    1.b) Deployment cost: 159K energy
    1.c) USDT withdrawal to Hot wallet cost: Approx. 65K energy per transfer
    1.d) This approach offers platforms the flexibility to balance transfer load to optimize energy pool availability, once balance is in the bussines owner SSWC 
    and owner energy is below a certain threshold owner can optionally wait to transfer that balance to its own hot-wallet/omni wallet/cold-wallet until energy pool is recovered.
2. Requirement Achieved 
3. Requirement Achieved
4. Requirement Achieved
